# PostgreSQL-Learning
Code and projects for learning PostgreSQL. I am learning using the book Practical SQL 2nd Edition by Anthony DeBarros and other online resources. The main goal is to understand how to create and manipulate data for understand how it works on a fundemental level and from a CyberSecurity standpoint. There will also be Python functions in the later projects.
